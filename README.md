# Intorduction
People looking after patients may encounter issues such as following up with patients to make sure the patients took their medicine doses based on the doctor's advice. Moreover, they need to schedule when the medicines need to be re-filled from the pharmacy. For instance, wives may want to make sure that their husbands are taking medicine on time and suggested amounts or check the health progress of their husbands during the medication course. Motma'an application is built with the intent to solve these issues. The app allows the patient to inform if he took the dose, and the person looking after him can check the patient's progress in taking his medicines. Moreover, doctors can easily view a report about the patient's progress. In other words, the doctor could know if the patient took all doses on time and followed the medication plan or he didnâ€™t. As a way to simplify the pharmacy supply chain and to encourage patients to continue taking their medications, a pharmacy that has pharmaceutical items available will be able to receive a prescription and will be able to deliver the pharmaceuticals. Basically, the application aims to solve two issues, which are following up with patients and scheduling medication re-fill deliveries. Due to the time limitation, the first version of the app focuses on the first service that allows the app users to follow up with the patient.

# Problem Statement
People with complex medication plans may have difficulty remembering when to take their doses or the exact amount to take. If an old person is suffering from diabetes or cardiovascular disease, he or she should take more than one medication course. They may forget to take critical doses, resulting in death or worsening their health. As this problem is of concern to the whole society, it could be of concern to parents with sick children, daughters caring for ageing parents, and grandparents whose loved ones may go missing due to this issue. A "Look After" application is designed to minimize the negative effects of forgetting a dose or taking an overdose in order to resolve this issue. As a result, the application will remind the patient to take his/her prescription in a timely manner, and the caregiver can be contacted to find out if the patient took the pills or not. Moreover, the application aims not only to resolve the issue from a patient and family perspective, but also from a physician, pharmacist, and logistics company perspective. A comprehensive report about the patient's behaviour in following the medication course will be provided to the doctors. Patients' pharmaceutical orders will be sent to pharmacies based on their needs. Orders will be collected from the pharmacy by the delivery man and delivered to the patients.
